{"name":"Irootlab","tagline":"Innovative toolbox for biospectroscopy in MATLAB","body":"### Welcome to irootlab page\r\n\r\nIRootLab is an open-source toolbox for vibrational spectroscopy data analysis in MATLAB. The project started in 2008 at Lancaster University, UK.\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nIf you find this software useful for you in your publication please cite the following paper:\r\n\r\nTrevisan, J., Angelov, P.P., Scott, A.D., Carmichael, P.L. & Martin, F.L. (2013) \"IRootLab: a free and open-source MATLAB toolbox for vibrational biospectroscopy data analysis\". Bioinformatics 29(8), 1095-1097. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt084. http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/12/bioinformatics.btt084.short\r\n\r\n### Code generation\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, irootlab is unique in its ability to generate MATLAB code as you operate on the toolbox GUIs. You can later take this auto-generated code as a basis for your own customized and/or systematic analysis.\r\n\r\n### Pipeline\r\n\r\nirootlab provides routines in the following stages of the biospectroscopy data processing pipeline:\r\n\r\n    Quality control,\r\n    Pre-processing,\r\n    Feature extraction,\r\n    Unsupervised clustering, and\r\n    Classification. \r\n\r\n### Visualization\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some visualization options\r\n\r\n    Scatter plots,\r\n    Loadings plots,\r\n    Feature histograms,\r\n    Confusion matrices,\r\n    Image maps,\r\n    HTML reports,\r\n    Decision surfaces,\r\n    Biomarker-Location plots\r\n    etc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Supported file types\r\n\r\nAs of today, the following file types are supported:\r\n\r\n    Three different formats of CSV (text files);\r\n    OPUS single spectrum files;\r\n    OPUS image maps;\r\n    Native .mat format. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
